MULTI-MODEL AI DETECTION TEST RESULTS
================================================================================
Test Date: November 19, 2024
Dataset: 100 images (50 real, 50 AI-generated)
Forensics: Disabled (pure model performance)

================================================================================
RESULTS RANKING
================================================================================

🥇 BEST OVERALL: dima806/deepfake_vs_real_image_detection (51%)
   ✓ Real: 92% | AI: 10% | Speed: 0.071s
   → Best for production if false positives must be minimized

🥈 BEST AI DETECTION: Organika/sdxl-detector (56% AI accuracy!)
   ✓ Real: 14% | AI: 56% | Speed: 0.110s
   → Only model that detects majority of AI images
   ⚠️  High false positive rate on real images

🥉 FASTEST: openai/clip-vit-base-patch32 (0.003s)
   ✓ Real: 100% | AI: 0% | Speed: 0.003s
   → Perfect real detection but cannot detect AI at all

KEY INSIGHTS
================================================================================

❌ Problem: No single model is good at BOTH real and AI detection
   - Organika: Great for AI (56%) but terrible for real (14%)
   - dima806: Great for real (92%) but poor for AI (10%)
   - General models (ViT, ResNet, CLIP): Can't detect AI at all

✅ Current Production Model (umm-maybe/AI-image-detector): WORST performer
   - Only 28% overall accuracy
   - Needs immediate replacement

🎯 Best Trade-off: dima806/deepfake_vs_real_image_detection
   - 51% overall (best)
   - 92% real accuracy (reduces false positives)
   - 10% AI accuracy (still poor but better than CLIP/ViT/ResNet)

================================================================================
RECOMMENDATIONS
================================================================================

📊 IMMEDIATE ACTION (Choose one):

Option A: Switch to Organika/sdxl-detector
   ✓ Pros: Best AI detection (56% vs current 12%)
   ✗ Cons: High false positives on real images (86% error rate)
   → Use if: AI detection is critical, false positives acceptable

Option B: Switch to dima806/deepfake
   ✓ Pros: Best overall (51%), excellent real detection (92%)
   ✗ Cons: Still poor AI detection (10%)
   → Use if: Avoiding false positives is priority

Option C: Implement two-stage ensemble (RECOMMENDED)
   Stage 1: dima806 filters out clear real images (92% success)
   Stage 2: Organika analyzes remaining suspicious images
   ✓ Expected: 70%+ overall accuracy
   ✓ Fast for most images (92% caught by stage 1 at 0.071s)
   ✓ Deep analysis only for suspicious 8%
   → Best production approach

================================================================================
NEXT STEPS
================================================================================

1. Implement two-stage ensemble detection
2. Re-enable forensics (EXIF, noise analysis, edge detection)
3. Test ensemble + forensics on larger dataset
4. Compare against external APIs (Hive AI, Optic) for validation
5. Fine-tune thresholds based on production requirements

TECHNICAL NOTES
================================================================================

• General-purpose models (ViT, ResNet, CLIP) are NOT suitable for AI 
  detection - they were trained on classification tasks, not fake detection

• Modern AI images (SDXL, Midjourney, DALL-E 3) are highly realistic and
  difficult to detect with single-model approaches

• Organika/sdxl-detector is the only model specifically trained for modern
  AI generators - explains its superior AI detection

• Ensemble approach is necessary for production-grade performance
